# Contributing

Hexdropper is an open source project. Contributions to this project are always welcome and appreciated! 

## Getting Started: General Tips and Guidelines:

The best and easiest way to contribute to this project is by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/hexdropper/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/hexdropper/pulls) on our GitHub repo. 

When submitting an issue or pull request, please be as detailed and specific as possible to ensure that other contributors fully understand the issues you are reporting or any proposed changes you are making. It is always better to err on the side of more explanations than less! :)

## Types of Contributions

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Write Documentation

You can never have enough documentation! Please feel free to contribute to any part of the documentation, such as the official docs, docstrings, examples, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

### Proposing New Features

If you are proposing a new feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work and try to be as specific as possible.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)
